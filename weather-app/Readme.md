Your Weather App
This page is a small, HTML- and JS-only (JQuery), website to show current basic weather information for a different cities using search by city or Google Maps Search.

API Key
The API keys is used in this project for Google Geocoding and for api.openweathermap.org.

Start Position
When site start the current position of User is set to "Lviv" by default. Enable location data is required.


Obviously would be better to provide your own API keys. 
API keys in App are only for development and testing.

Due to the lack of time, this project is not unfinished. 
I can potentially rework it using React Redux.
